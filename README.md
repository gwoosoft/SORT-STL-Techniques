# SORT-STL-Techniques

I upload this source code for me to memorize the syntax of how to use sort STL to apply different algorithm for competitive programming/coding challenges. 

I do not usually memorize a code but sometimes some STL we have to know the syntax, and know how to apply it otherwise it would be too consuming to implement.
